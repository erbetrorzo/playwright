## Key Features and Benefits of Origin 80 Software
 
Origin 80 software has many features and benefits that make it a preferred choice for data analysis and graphing. Here are some of them:
 
- **Over 100 built-in and extended graph types**: Origin 80 software can create various types of graphs, such as line, scatter, bar, pie, box, contour, surface, waterfall, heatmap, vector, ternary, radar, polar, etc. You can also customize every aspect of your graphs, such as axes, legends, titles, labels, colors, symbols, lines, fills, etc. You can also add additional axes and panels, or combine multiple graphs in one layer or page.
- **Data exploration tools**: Origin 80 software allows you to explore your data interactively using tools such as zooming, panning, data filtering, data slicing, data extraction, data highlighting, etc. You can also use tools such as Data Reader, Data Info Window, Data Cursor, etc. to inspect your data values and coordinates.
- **Data analysis and statistics tools**: Origin 80 software can perform various types of data analysis and statistics tasks, such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression analysis,
correlation analysis,
principal component analysis,
cluster analysis,
survival analysis,
etc. You can also use Origin 80 software to fit curves and surfaces to your data using linear or nonlinear models,
or to analyze peaks in your data using built-in or custom peak functions.
- **Signal processing tools**: Origin 80 software can process signals such as audio,
electrocardiogram,
seismic,
etc. using tools such as Fourier transform,
wavelet transform,
filtering,
smoothing,
envelope extraction,
hilbert transform,
etc. You can also use Origin 80 software to generate signals such as sine wave,
square wave,
sawtooth wave,
etc.
- **Mathematics tools**: Origin 80 software can perform various mathematical operations on your data or expressions using tools such as differentiation,
integration,
matrix operations,
differential equations,
etc. You can also use Origin 80 software to evaluate expressions or functions numerically or symbolically.
- **Data processing tools**: Origin 80 software can manipulate your data using tools such as sorting,
ranking,
transposing,
reshaping,
merging,
splitting,
interpolating,
extrapolating,
normalizing,
etc. You can also use Origin 80 software to import or export your data from or to various formats such as Excel,
CSV,
TXT,
MATLABâ¢
LabVIEWâ¢
etc.
- **Batch processing tools**: Origin 80 software can automate your repetitive tasks using tools such as Batch Plotting,
