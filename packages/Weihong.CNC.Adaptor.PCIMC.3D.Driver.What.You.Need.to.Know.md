## How to Use the Weihong CNC Adaptor PCIMC 3D Driver
 
After installing the driver, you can use the NcStudio software to control your CNC machine. The NcStudio software has various functions such as programming, simulation, monitoring, debugging, and parameter setting. You can refer to the NcStudio Programming Manual[^1^] or the NcStudio User Manual[^1^] for more details on how to use the software. Here are some basic steps on how to use the NcStudio software:

1. Connect your CNC machine to your computer via a USB cable or a network cable. Make sure that both devices are powered on and that the CNC machine is in standby mode.
2. Open the NcStudio software on your computer. You should see a main interface with several tabs such as File, Edit, View, Operation, Toolpath, Parameter, Help, etc.
3. Create or open a G-code file that contains the instructions for your CNC machine. You can use the built-in editor or import a file from another software such as AutoCAD or ArtCAM. You can also use the simulation function to preview the machining process and check for errors.
4. Set up the parameters for your CNC machine such as spindle speed, feed rate, tool diameter, coordinate system, etc. You can use the parameter tab or click on the icons on the toolbar to access different settings.
5. Click on the operation tab and then select âStartâ to send the G-code file to your CNC machine. You can also use other buttons such as Pause, Stop, Reset, etc. to control your CNC machine. You can monitor the machining status and progress on the screen or on the panel of your CNC machine.
6. When the machining is finished, you can disconnect your CNC machine from your computer and remove your workpiece from the table. You can also save your G-code file or export it to another format if needed.
